# Clustering-XENONnT

The goal of this research was to improve the identification of possible dark matter candidates in the XENONnT collaboration. By correctly identifying multiple scatter events in the vessel, we can remove the double scatter events from the possible dark matter candidates. As part of this project, I have written a new pipeline to identify these double scatter events in the X-Y plane of XENONnT. The new pipeline found one of the first-ever double scatter events in XENONnT, and will be further improved upon by the Nikhef dark matter group.
